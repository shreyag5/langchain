    "In this notebook, we demonstrate the functionality of the MiimansaClinicalTextRetriever. This tool is designed to enhance the retrieval of clinical texts by leveraging a pre-existing question bank. The process involves checking if a similar question is present in the question bank, and if found, returning the corresponding context. Otherwise, it retrieves the top_k most relevant contexts for the given query using a traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach."
